# Website for Stony Brook Computing Society

## About this project
* This website was converted and adapted from the previous SBCS website built by Reid Horton. 
* This uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the single page website. 

## Issues to fix up
* Clean up extra CSS styles
* On mobile/web, the glyciphon is missing when window size is too small

## Contributers
* Lise Ho (current secretary of SBCS)
